Discover, by Dr.Chrono, is a healthcare booking platform designed for the digital consumer. It enables individuals to book a healthcare appointment at a time and place that works for them. This concept was created for the [Dr.Chrono Virtual Healthcare Hackathon (2021)](https://devpost.com/software/discover-book-a-healthcare-appointment-anywhere-anytime). A demo and pitch can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVF4SFZnhps).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It can be run by cloning the repository and running

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The website will then be live on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). However, the project uses private `.env` values for MongoDB and Google Maps API access, which are *not* included within the repository. To have a full end-to-end workflow, please [reach out](mailto:jiafrank98@gmail.com) and I'd be happy to help.
